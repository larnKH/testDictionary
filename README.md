In mathematics, an annulus (the Latin word for little ring, with plural annuli) is a ring-shaped geometric figure, or more generally, a term used to name a ring-shaped object.
The area of such an annulus is given by the difference in the areas of a circle of radius R and one of radius r:
Interestingly, the area of an annulus can also be obtained by multiplying pi by the square of half of the length of the longest interval that can lie completely inside the annulus.
The spring encircling rigid annulus in the spring wheel is resiliently supported against radial motion relative to the wheel center by mechanism wherein thrust or tension is applied to the springs laterally of the wheel.
In a spring wheel having a spring encircling rigid annulus supported by an annular pneumatic spring, with guide means and combined drive, the drive consists of interfitting irregularities of the contacting annular surfaces of the rigid annulus and the annular spring, or of irregularities upon the rigid annulus which indent the spring.
In a spring wheel having a spring encircling rigid annulus supported by an annular pneumatic spring, with drive, the drive consists of interfitting irregularities of the contacting annular surfaces of the rigid annulus and the annular spring, or of irregularities upon the rigid annulus which indent the spring.
The phase contrast annuli (annulus is the Latin term for ring, with the plural being annuli) utilized in the substage condenser on an upright microscope, or within the condenser turret on the illumination pillar of an inverted microscope, must be specifically matched to a particular objective equipped with a corresponding phase plate.
Locate the condenser annulus centering pins (or screws) and adjust the position of the annulus with a pair of screwdrivers or the appropriate knobs until it is coincident with the objective phase plate (Figure 1(e)).
In this case, it may be difficult (or impossible) to superimpose the condenser annulus on the phase plate without a drop of oil between the condenser lens and the microscope slide (and/or between the objective and the coverslip).
The annulus is shown in red in the diagram on the right, along with an example of a suitable path of integration labelled γ.
More generally, Laurent series can be used to express holomorphic functions defined on an annulus, much as power series are used to express holomorphic functions defined on a disc.
On the boundary of the annulus, one cannot make a general statement, except to say that there is at least one point on the inner boundary and one point on the outer boundary such that f(z) cannot be holomorphically continued to those points.

Briefly, an annulus is the region bounded between two (usually concentric) circles.
An open annulus, or just annulus for short, is a domain in the complex plane of the form
This is version 1 of annulus, born on 2003-04-22.
Annulus present, may be narrow; exine varying from 1-6 µm; pores varying from 10 to over 30, distinct.
Pores varying from 10-20; annulus often broad or of medium breadth, rarely narrow; largest columellae rounded or rounded angular, often smaller towards the pores; in SEM the number of scabrae decreasing towards the pores.
Pores large or small; annulus distinct, relatively broad; columellae not markedly decreasing in size towards the pores; a large number of small columellae attached to the annulus.
With the ideally supported annulus, load sharing between the planets is ensured by the radial flexibility and uniform loading across the teeth by the self correcting toroidal twisting of the annulus and by the high accuracy of the gearing.
Toroidal twisting effect on the annulus is reduced to a minim by having the tubular extension thin, and nearly in line with the axial thrust from the teeth.
Other designs include the Allen-Stoeckicht where the split annulus of a double epicyclic gear are given a degree of movement within the carrier fo the two rings, this carrier itself is given a degree of axial movement by being fixed to the outer casing by a straight cut tooth coupling.

Although this name was widely used for nearly all members of the genus until the 1970's, true Armillaria mellea has a smaller distribution, occurring mainly in the southeastern United States up into the northeast into Québec and in the midwest in the hardwood forests, although it is occasionally found on conifers in mixed forests.
Calcification of the mitral annulus is a degenerative process associated with aging.
Usually only the annulus of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve calcifies, and this is felt to be a benign conditin, but is often associated with mitral insufficiency or regurgitation.
The aortic annulus is calcified less commonly than the mitral, and the tricuspid is only seen calcified when associated with long standing pulmonary hypertension.
When I was first informed of the use of annulus gel, I was amazed at the generosity of Region IV in accepting such a procedure, and acted the devil's advocate in my early discussions about said technology with Fred McManus, then a UIC enforcement officer (see May 17,1990 letter).
Annulus gel was researched at EPA's Kerr Lab in Ada, Oklahoma, and it is likely that the use of annulus gel as an acceptable annular fluid in Region IV for the standard annular pressure test (SAPT) grew out of said research.
However, bentonite annulus gel has worked beautifully in many wells in Region IV (and perhaps elsewhere) and should be allowed as it was in the past.
The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the means for separating condensed annulus effluent vapor further comprises an injection port for the injection of at least one chemical to aid in separating the condensed vapor into water, oil and light hydrocarbon condensate phases.
A computation means may be employed for calculating the flow rate of the annulus effluent vapor, the flow rate of the entrained liquids, the amount of each phase in the annulus effluent and the total heat flow rate as well as the heat flow rate for each phase in the annulus effluent.
By identifying the components of the annulus effluent and the relative quantity of each of those components, and obtaining the steam quality and the mass flow rates of the annulus effluent, wells which should be shut in and wells which should be worked over can be identified.
There is a monitoring of annulus pressure (MAP) [a/k/a SAMT] mechanical integrity test (MIT) that is a creature of 40 CFR §146.8(b)(1), but Region IV has never approved its use in Kentucky, and it should not be confused with monitoring requirements set out elsewhere in the regulations.
Timko, Lindahl and Schweikhardt comment on monitoring annulus pressure with the annulus closed as follows: The danger arises in that a leak in the casing to a permeable zone could inhibit pressure buildup which would otherwise be caused by a leak in tubing.
The possibility that a closed annulus could mask detection of a leak in the tubing and casing should be sufficient to recommend against a closed annulus.
An annulus is defined as a zone of close circuli marking the end of a year of growth, i.e., the winter growth zone.
The end of an annulus (i.e., the last true winter circulus in the winter growth zone) is generally followed by a rapid transition from narrow to widening interspaces, signifying the start of the next period of rapid summer growth.
This type of annulus construction (i.e., two close zones) is generally described as a split annulus, since it is usually difficult to determine which zone is the check and which is the annulus (Fig.
Annulus: A ringlike structure, or any body part that is shaped like a ring.
The base of a heart valve that supports the valve's leaflets is called the annulus.
The width of an annulus is the difference between the radius of the outer circle and radius of the inner circle of the annulus.
The area of an annulus is the area of the region between the outer and the inner circle.
As of this date, the hyaline zone evident on the edge of the otolith until spring growth resumption is interpreted as an annulus.
In general, a split annulus may be distinguished from an annulus close to the edge (due to retarded seasonal growth) by the strength and width of the hyaline zone near the edge.
When arrows on the opposite sides point in the same direction as, for example, is the case of the annulus, we identify (glue together) points without twisting the sides.
The vertical solid line on the rightmost diagram is the seam where two sides of the original square have been glued together.
Cutting an annulus along a horizontal line results in two separate cylinders of a smaller height.
Annulus pressure monitoring for Class I wells required at § 146.13(b)(2) to verify the maintenance of a minimum pressure differential is not the SAMT, because changes in pressure due to loss of annulus liquid are attenuated by the presence of a gas blanket which is replenished as pressure decreases.
Annulus monitoring may continue throughout the life of the well or the operator may choose, at any time, to conduct a SAPT every five years and after well reworks (on rule authorized Class II wells and on permitted wells if the particular UIC permit allows it), thereby discontinuing the SAMT.
For a small annulus which might be typical of a Class II well (4-1/2 inch, 11.6 lb/ft. casing and 2-3/8 inch tubing, pressurized to 300 psi), just under one half gallon of liquid should be returned for each 1,000 feet of depth to the packer.
Verify that the annulus blocks are correctly seated on the ladder blocks.
Making sure that the north side is toward the north annulus, lower the dummy ladder (with attached annulus blocks) towards the annuli.
Re--verify that the annulus blocks are correctly seated on the ladder blocks and that the dummy ladder steps are correctly seated.
The annulus forms during invasion and is caused by the different mobilities of oil and water.
The annulus has approximately the same water saturation as the flushed zone but contains formation water.
When the formation water is much more saline than the mud filtrate, the annulus forms a conductive ring around the borehole.
Annulus pressure relief is imperative in relation to systems.
Annulus pressure relief is a pressure relief device for off-shore well test membranes, single element rupture discs.
This interactive tutorial examines variations in how specimens appear through the eyepieces (at different magnifications) when the condenser annulus is shifted into and out of alignment with the phase plate in the objective.
As an alternative to translating the sliders, the mouse cursor can be used to drag the condenser annulus image within the window so that it can be positioned anywhere within the periphery of the objective phase plate.
Presented in Figure 1 are images of the objective rear focal plane in misalignment (Figure 1(a) and 1(c)) and after the condenser annulus and phase ring have been properly aligned (Figure 1(e)).
Adding materials to the liquid in the annulus to change the properties of the liquid to prevent or diminish flow through the leak or to mechanically plug the leak.
Reliance on the use of additives to the annulus fluid to provide a permanent solution to leakage has been controversial because of the untested belief that additives to the annulus liquid will not provide long-term sealing properties.
The annulus pressure and/or liquid level are frequently monitored and reported along with additions of liquid to the annulus system so that any increase in leak rate will be identified in a timely manner.

We hypothesized that a median nerve block would cause (1) a decrease in force production, which would be direction-dependent with the most severe reduction in the abduction direction, and (2) a decrease in the force envelope area and force quadrant area, with the greatest decrease in the abduction quadrant.
The median nerve innervates the abductor pollicis brevis, the opponens pollicis and superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis, all of which contribute to the abduction and flexion of the thumb [4]; therefore, denervation of these muscles after median nerve block would cause the greatest force deficit related to median nerve function [5].

Borehole data are direct measurements of temperature from boreholes drilled into the Earth crust.
Borehole Data and Climate Reconstructions from University of Michigan's (UM) Global Database
Pollack and Smerdon 2004 Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric averages
The borehole fluid flow measuring apparatus of claim 1 wherein said detectors comprise light emitting diodes operably disposed so that an optical path between each diode and its corresponding detector is alternatively established and interrupted responsive to the rotation of the disk.
Borehole fluid may of course travel from the bottom of the hole upwardly for the case of a producing well where fluids are produced from a perforated zone and are flowing upwardly in the well.
In certain deviated boreholes even though the flow may be primarily in one direction from the bottom to the top of the hole, in certain locations in the hole, say in a lateral portion of it, the flow may be in both directions.
In the latter case the air is not capable of supporting the borehole walls after drilling and accordingly this type of drill should not be used on sandy formations or in formations where the borehole may collapse after drilling.
A borehole screen, as the name implies, is a type of strainer which is placed in the water bearing sand in a borehole which allows water to enter the borehole but prevents sand from entering.
Simplified this entails pumping a borehole and measuring the amount by which the water level drops at varying flow rates and then measuring the time for the water level to recover to it's original depth after pumping is stopped.
Borehole geophysics, as defined here, is the science of recording and analyzing measurements in boreholes or wells, for determining physical and chemical properties of soils and rocks.
One technique that is available for determining the extent of alteration of rock and fluid properties adjacent to the borehole is the use of different spacing between source and detector in acoustic or nuclear probes or between electrodes in resistivity probes.
Boreholes that have been carefully cored, where the cores have been analyzed quantitatively, also may be used to calibrate logging probes.
Geophysical borehole logging involves gradually lowering a probe down a borehole, while the probe measures a physical property of the surrounding rock or soil.
The array of available probes, designed to measure different properties, enables borehole logging to be used in a wide variety of applications, where boreholes are present.
Within the normal range of operation of the borehole equipment, the quadrature signal (i.e., the signal 90° out of phase with the primary field) is proportional to the conductivity of the material surrounding the borehole (soil or rock).
In acoustic logging, a transmitter located in the borehole emits a pulse of mechanical energy which is recorded by one or more receivers located in the borehole some distance away from the transmitter.
The character of the waveform is determined by the mode content, which depends on such factors as the mechanical properties of the rock around the borehole, the compressional velocity in the borehole fluid, the source frequency and the borehole size.
Noise that is present at the start of the waveform (caused by vibrations in the probe as it bumps along the borehole) may be strong enough at one or both receivers to cross the threshold.
Borehole radar is based on the same principles as ground penetrating radar systems for surface use, which means that it consists of a radar transmitter and receiver built into separate probes.
(omnidiretionally) Borehole radar interpretation is similar to that of surface GPR data with the exception of the space interpretation.
The standard surface GPR transmitter is positioned at different distances from the borehole on the ground and the borehole receiver probe is lowered into the borehole.
The borehole is assumed to be circular and a borehole radius, an eccentering distance (the distance between the circular borehole and the center of the tool), and an azimuth are determined from the ultrasonic standoff measurements.
Birchak assumes that the borehole is circular and attempts to determine the radius of the circle, the eccentering distance, and an azimuth.
At intermediate times, the borehole parameter vector may be assumed to remain substantially unchanged and the standoff measurements, azimuth measurements, and the previously determined borehole parameter vector, may be utilized to determine the lateral displacement of the tool in the borehole.
The data collected in a borehole represents a single point in the plan view of a site.  Also, the radius of investigation may be small, and not completely representative of the bulk formation.
The data are acquired by moving a string of instruments up or down the borehole, and measuring the electrical, natural gamma, sonic, electromagnetic, borehole diameter, fluid flow, and temperature responses.
The caliper log measures the diameter of the borehole, and the fluid flow meter measures the volumetric rate of flow of borehole fluid that moves up or down the borehole.
The acoustic borehole televiewer log is a magnetically oriented, 360 degree, photograph-like image of the acoustic reflectivity of the borehole wall.
Deviation of boreholes from the vertical is common, and deviation logs are used to calculate true vertical depth of features of interest and to correct the strike and dip of fractures or bedding obtained from acoustic televiewer logs.
Heatpulse-flowmeter measurements may be influenced by poor seal integrity between the borehole and the flowmeter or contributions of water from storage within the borehole during pumping.
Borehole engineering logging surveys are performed to accurately acquire rock properties, structural stress-strain relationships, fracture statistics, and other in-situ properties for major tunneling and engineering projects.
The probe is lowered to the bottom of the borehole to verify total depth and then raised slightly to the first measurement point.
Because boreholes are required, there is the opportunity to obtain more site-specific geotechnical information, which, when integrated with the seismic data, yields the best assessment for the engineering application (liquefaction, deformation, or strong motion Characterization).
Borehole wells are becoming increasingly popular as a clean evironmentally friendly alternative source of water to the ever increasing costs of mains supply water for domestic commercial and industrial installations.
A borehole is a well usually about 4-6 wide drilled to a depth of around 50-100m, depending on the depth of the water table at the siting of the borehole.
A test borehole needs to be drilled to establish water quality, the depth of the water surface and the volume of water in the well.
Borehole gravity is a density logging method that has been available for over 30 years -- yet today it is a seldom-used technique, even though there are numerous published case studies that demonstrate its value.
Thus the amplitude and wavelength of the density difference is diagnostic in determining the distance of the remote mass away from the borehole.
Borehole gravity is not only capable of imaging past a gas cone to determine the true top of the gas-oil contact, but it is also capable of determining the shape of the cone, as these models show.
Borehole mining is used for surface and underground mining.
With borehole mining, a hole is drilled deep enough into the ground to reach whatever is going to be mined.
Also, borehole mining works in places that would be very dangerous to mine with other kinds of mining.
The borehole is drilled to depths of about 150 m and cased using a steel pipe.
The cement is forced upwards to fill the gap between the walls of the 8-inch borehole and the 6-inch diameter casing.
Once the borehole has been cased the bottom of the borehole is cored another 30 to 100 feet.
Breakouts are zones of failure of the borehole wall which form symmetrically at the azimuth of the least principal horizontal stress [e.g.
[1997] reports from the KTB borehole that both mechanisms can be identified in rock samples and cuttings: compressive shear failure and extensional splitting of flakes due to the high tangential stress and a lack of ``confining pressure'' from the drill fluid.
In spite of the still not fully resolved issues of formation and stabilization, it has been found that borehole breakouts in vertical boreholes can reliably be used as indicators of the direction of the least horizontal principal stress [e.g.
Borehole resistivity methods measure the electrical resistivity of the subsurface by lowering a probe down a borehole.
Borehole resistivity can be used to study lateral changes and vertical cross sections of the natural hydrogeologic setting.
Borehole resistivity can also be used to study soil and groundwater contamination.
borehole video camera was used to investigate the 3-dimensional structure and characteristics of the deforming ice-mass.
The video camera was lowered through 16 different boreholes giving observation of more than 875 m2 of subglacial ice in the walls of more than 2750 m of borehole.
View is looking down the borehole, which is at the center of the image.
Borehole geophysics provide a means of evaluating a great variety of physical properties of subsurface rocks, sediments, and fluids.
Borehole logging offers an economical alternative to continuous sampling or coring, furnishing continuous, objective data sets in a graphical form that can be rapidly interpreted in the field.
Depth encoded images from the borehole camera are recorded for later review, and provide a permanent record of open borehole conditions, fractures, well screen placement, cracks in casing, etc.
Similarly, Harris and Chapman (2001) analyzed 439 borehole temperature logs in an effort to determine the temperature history of the mid-latitude sector (30-60°N) of the Northern Hemisphere.
Whereas most boreholes do not exceed a depth of 1 km, which limits the temporal duration of surface temperature reconstructions by this method to only the past few centuries, Demezhko and Shchapov (2001) studied a borehole extending to more than 5 km depth, which allowed them to reconstruct an 80,000-year history of ground surface temperature.
(2005) analyzed high-quality borehole temperature data retrieved from four boreholes in quasi-steady state located within a small region in northern Quebec, to ascertain whether records of surface air temperature collected nearby reproduce the subsurface temperature anomalies observed in the area.
Our geologists and geophysicists carry out borehole surveys using a wide range of intelligent tools, which, if required, can be used in various combinations.
Borehole surveys are used to determine geological and geotechnical parameters, a knowledge of which is often vital for the later stages of planning.
Based on the borehole investigations and the interpretation of the data acquired, geological models of deposits for instance can be generated or soil and rock mechanics applications planned.
The spalling was observed to occur at diametrically opposed points on the borehole wall perpendicular to the direction of the maximum principal stress.
The cracks are densely spaced and subparallel both to the borehole wall and the maximum horizontal stress direction.
Cracks initiates at the borehole wall, were intergranular and propagated along a pth of high shear stress.
Mud-rotary units have been used, however, the last 10 feet of the borehole must be drilled in the absence of drilling muds to assure the absence of pore-clogging muds within the borehole.
How the borehole is completed will also depend on local regulations as well as what contaminants are to be expected.
Where a collapsing borehole is not likely, the installation may be backfilled with a clean, sorted sand of appropriate sieve size.
Borehole logs are used to display the results of oil and gas, mining, geotechnical and environmental drilling and sampling.

Crude oil - as petroleum directly out of the ground is called - is a remarkably varied substance, both in its use and composition.
Second, migration of the oil from the source rock to a reservoir rock, usually a sandstone or limestone that's thick and porous enough to hold a sizable accumulation of oil.
Crude oil may not be the panacea that snake oil claimed to be.
Crude oil is the term for unprocessed oil, the stuff that comes out of the ground.
Crude oil is a fossil fuel, meaning that it was made naturally from decaying plants and animals living in ancient seas millions of years ago -- anywhere you find crude oil was once a sea bed.
Crude oils vary in color, from clear to tar-fl, and in viscosity, from water to almost solid.
The name is derived from the fl color of crude oil combined with its status as a highly valuable resource, serving in the industrial age, in many ways, the same role that gold did in the pre-industrial era.
Crude oil washing meant that the mixture of oil and water which led to so much operational pollution in the past was virtually ended.
Crude oil washing was made mandatory for new tankers by the 1978 Protocol to the MARPOL Convention.
Classification of crude oil types by geographical source is generally not a useful classification scheme for response personnel because they offer little information about general toxicity, physical state, and changes that occur with time and weathering.
In 1972 the price of crude oil was about $3.00 per barrel and by the end of 1974 the price of oil had quadrupled to over $12.00.
Drilling an oil or gas well is a capital investment in the expectation of returns from the production and sale of crude oil or natural gas.
In spite of all of these efforts the percentage of rigs employed in drilling for crude oil decreased from over 60 percent of total rigs at the beginning of 1988 to under 15 percent until a recent resurgence.

For sponge fishing no accurate statistics are available before 1896; in that year 75 tons of sponges were secured, but there has been considerable diminution since, only 31 tons being obtained in 1902.
Garrison, a fishing station on the wild Lough Melvin, and Pettigo, near to the lower Lough Erne, are market villages.
Fishing and trawling are carried on chiefly off the Italian (especially Ligurian, Austrian and Tunisian coasts; coral is found principally near Sardinia and Sicily, and sponges almost exclusively off Sicily arid Tunisia in tile neighborhood of Sfax.
The inhabitants of these islands support themselves by seafaring, pilotage, grazing of cattle and sheep, fishing and a little agriculture, chiefly potato-growing.
Besides the above, Boulogne, the most important fishing port in the country, Calais, Dieppe, Concarneau, Douarnenez, Les Sables dOlonne, La Rochelle, Marennes and Arcachon are leading ports for the herring, sardine, mackerel and other coast-fisheries of the ocean, while Cette, Agde and other Mediterranean ports are engaged in the tunny and anchovy fisheries.

Some of these are on the south-west coast, in the Landes, as Carcans, Lacanau, Biscarosse, Cazau, Sanguinet; but more are to be found in the south and south-east, in Languedoc and Provence, as Leucate, Sigean, Thau, Vaccars, Berre, &c. Their want of depth prevents them from serving as roadsteads for shipping, and they are useful chiefly for fishing or for the manufacture of bay-salt.
There are excellent fishing grounds on the coast, but they have had no appreciable influence in developing a commerical marine.
Rice cultivation and fishing occupy practically all the inhabitants of the district.
The fishing population of France is most numerous in the Breton departments of Finisire, Cfltes-du-Nord and Morbihan and in Pas-de-Calais.
The bows differ altogether with each group, but the same two kinds of arrows are in general use: (1) long and ordinary for fishing and other purposes; (2) short with a detachable head fastened to the shaft by a thong, which quickly brings pigs up short when shot in the thick jungle.
The lagoon fisheries are also of great importance, more especially those of Comacchio, the lagoon of Orbetello and the Mare Piccolo at Taranto &c The deep-sea fishing boats in 1902 numbered 1368, with a total tonnage of 16,149; 100 of these were coral-fishing boats and 111 sponge-fishing boats.

Garrison, a fishing station on the wild Lough Melvin, and Pettigo, near to the lower Lough Erne, are market villages.
A bone fracture is a medical condition in which a bone becomes cracked, splintered, or bisected as a result of physical trauma.
A greenstick fracture occurs because the bone is not as brittle as it would be in an adult, and thus does not completely fracture, but rather exhibits bowing without complete disruption of the bone's cortex.
To this end, a fractured limb is usually immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast which holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture.
The word fracture is often applied to bones of living creatures, or to crystals or crystalline materials, such as gemstones or metal.
Depending on the substance which is fractured, a fracture reduces strength (most substances) or inhibits transmission of light (optical crystals).
In amorphous solids, by contrast, the lack of a crystalline structure means that any direction may be considered a cleavage plane; the result is a conchoidal fracture, with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension.
A closed fracture is a fracture in which the skin of the lower leg is not broken.
An open fracture is classified according to the degree of skin disruption, and whether or not there is significant soft tissue loss, blood vessel disruption, or gross contamination.
A fracture of the tibia is serious because this bone heals slowly and sometimes poorly because of the sparse blood supply in some areas of the bone.
In an impacted fracture, the pieces are jammed together by the force of the injury, and we may not see a fracture line because the bony pieces are pushed into each other.
Fractures usually are splinted or casted to place the injured part at-rest, avoiding movement of the fracture pieces while they are healing.
In some minor fractures where a deformity does not have to be corrected, such as a minor fracture of a toe, some simple method might be used to hold the pieces in-place.
A stable fracture is one in which the pelvis remains stable and involves one break-point in the pelvic ring with minimal hemorrhage.
An unstable fracture is one in which the pelvis is unstable with two or more break-points in the pelvic ring with moderate to severe hemorrhage.
Depending on the severity of the fracture, other imaging procedures may be required as well, such as contrasting studies involving the injection of a radioactive dye; the pictures can be used to evaluate organs and structures in the pelvic area, such as the urethra, bladder, and blood vessels.
Fracture is a very complex process that involves the nucleation and growth of micro and macro voids or cracks, mechanisms of dislocations, flip bands, and propagation of microcracks, and the geometry of the material.
The energy necessary to fracture the test piece is directly calculated from the difference in initial and final heights of the swinging pendulum (Figure 7.).
A fatigue fracture will have two distinct regions; One being smooth or burnished as a result of the rubbing of the bottom and top of the crack(steps 1 and 2); The second is granular, due to the rapid failure of the material.
Hip fractures are fractures of the neck of the femur; the long bone that comprises the upper part of the leg.
In the U.S., the cost of hip fracture is approximately 7 billion dollars annually, and hip fracture is the second most common cause of admission to nursing homes, accounting for some 60,000 admissions each year.
With a pelvic fracture, this may be achieved by tying the legs together at the ankles and knees and transporting on a firm surface (backboard).
Bone fracture repairs are surgical procedures to realign and stabilize broken bones (fractures) with plates, nails, screws, or pins.
If examination of the fracture shows that a quantity of bone has been lost as a result of the fracture, especially if there is a gap between the broken bone ends, the surgeon may decide that a bone graft is essential to avoid delayed healing.
This is especially true of fractures that involve joints, as misalignment of joint surfaces may contribute to the development of arthritis.

Spiral fracture of the shaft of the fifth metatarsal.
Fracture on one side of the bone, causing a bend on the other side of the bone.
As soon as a fracture occurs, the body acts to protect the injured area, forming a protective blood clot and callus or fibrous tissue.
The fracture is closed and the callus is absorbed.
A bone fracture is diagnosed by a physical examination and x-rays of the injured area.
Severe fractures may require internal devices, such as screws, rods, or plates, to hold the bone in place or replace lost bone during the healing process.
The length of time it takes for a bone fracture to heal and the need for physical therapy after treatment depend upon the severity of the fracture and the age and health of the patient.

A compound fracture is actually a fracture in which the skin is broken over the bone.
A comminuted fracture is a fracture with many pieces but it does not go through the skin.
Examples include: boxer's fracture of the metacarpal bone of the hand, blowout fracture of the bones behind the eye, and stress fracture of the bones of tibia. Some fractures are also named by conditions associated with the bone breakage.
For example, a compound fracture is a fracture in which there is an associated open wound of the skin that leads directly to the broken bone.
The treatment of a fracture depends on the type of fracture, its severity and location, as well as the underlying condition of the patient.
A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault.
When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint.
Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow.
A family history of osteoporosis or fractures later in life is a strong predictor of low bone mass, although not necessarily of fractures themselves.
The type of surgery you have generally depends on the part of the hip that fractured, the severity of the fracture and your age.
In general, for fractures in which bones aren't well aligned, the older you are the more likely you are to receive a prosthesis.

Chrysotile serpentine is a typical mineral with splintery fracture and kyanite is an example of a non-fibrous mineral that has this fracture.
Fracture, open: A fracture in which the bone is sticking through the skin.
It usually is a result of trauma but can be due to an acquired disease of bone such as osteoporosis or abnormal formation of bone in a congenital disease of bone such as osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease).
Unlike cleavages, which are usually clean, flat breaks, fractures can be smoothly curved, irregular, jagged or splintery.
The most common types of fracture are conchoidal (quartz), fibrous or splintery, hackly (copper), uneven or irregular.
The sample of malachite shown here has a conchoidal fracture; it's smooth and curved.
The goal of research into fracture at the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics is to study fracture as a dynamical system; to understand how dynamics at small scales works out in phenomena at the macroscopic scale.
We have shown that there is a forbidden band of velocities in low-temperature crystals where crack propagation is impossible, that above this band cracks propagate stably, and that above a critical energy flux they become unstable to a micro-cracking instability surprisingly reminiscent of the experiments in amorphous materials.

Alkanes are also often known as paraffins, or collectively as the paraffin series; these terms, however, are also used to apply only to alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain; when this is done, branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins.
Alkanes are compounds of carbon and hydrogen atoms held together by single bonds.
Alkanes are generally unreactive because the C-H and C-C single bonds are stable and difficult to break.
Alkanes are insoluble in water because the polar water molecules are not attracted to the non-polar alkane molecules.

In addition, the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms (see figure): the cause of this phenomenon is the higher packing density of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms.
In discussing the alkanes as a functional group, the terms aliphatic (for the acyclic alkane substituent) and alicyclic (for the cyclic alkane substituent) are used.
Organometallic coupling: a process that uses a copper lithium dialkyl reagent as an intermediate in the synthesis of longer chain alkanes by reaction with a primary alkyl halide.
RNS Number:6321X Alkane Energy PLC 15 April 2004 15 April 2004 Alkane Energy plc (Alkane) Announces Acquisition of Farmatic Biotech Energy UK Ltd (FBE) Alkane is pleased to announce that it has acquired an 83% interest in FBE through an investment of #150,000 of new shares in FBE.
The alkanes and cycloalkanes, with the exception of cyclopropane, are probably the least chemically reactive class of organic compounds.
The alkanes and their derivatives with or fewer carbons have non- systematic common names established by long precedence.
The alkanes are said to be saturated because the maximum number of bonds are formed between each carbon atoms and its neighboring carbon and hydrogen atoms.
The alkanes are sometimes referred to as the methane series (after the simplest alkane) or as paraffins.
The alkanes are the hydrocarbons where all of the carbons are bonded to the other carbon atoms by single bonds.
The alkane with the simplest structure is methane, CH4.
The atoms in alkanes with more than carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple forming different isomers.
The density of an alkane is less than 1.
The first alkane, methane, is one carbon with four hydrogen, each hydrogen taking up one bond on the carbon atom; the second, ethane, is two carbons single-bonded surrounded by six hydrogen taking up the other bonds.
The genes rubA and rubB for alkane degradation in Acinetobacter sp.
The number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms; for acyclic alkanes with n = 1.12 carbon atoms, the number of isomers equals 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18, 35, 75, 159, 355.
The problem has been that the bonds between an alkane's carbon and hydrogen atoms are so strong as to render alkanes generally unreactive.
The problem has been that the bonds between an alkane's carbon and hydrogen atoms are strong enough to render alkanes generally unreactive.
The saturated open-chain hydrocarbons form a homologous series called the alkane, or paraffin, series.
The series of alkanes is often called the paraffin series.
The shapes of the alkanes shows that all bonds on the carbon atoms are identical and that the bond angles are close to 109 degrees.
The simplest alkane is methane, CH The next members of the family are ethane.
This calculation is worked out on the basis that in 2005 there were 92 million Alkane shares in issue and the company saves around 400,000* tonnes of CO2 per year by capturing methane and turning it into green energy.
This enabled the researchers to irradiate alkanes and the organometallic complexes with ultraviolet light and measure the kinetics at room temperature with the compounds dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent.
This naked or unsolvated 16-electron complex was finally detected and the rates of its reaction with alkanes were measured when the researcher carried out time-resolved infra red experiments in the gas phase.
Three more CMM projects are in the pre-development phase, one of which Alkane hopes to complete by the end of the year.
to indicate that the compound is an alkane; e.g., alkanes with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 carbon atoms in their molecules are pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane, respectively.
Unlike the complex transformations of combustion, the halogenation of an alkane appears to be a simple substitution reaction in which a C-H bond is broken and a new C-X bond is formed.
Furthermore, there was no evidence of ethyl esters, dimers, alkanes or alkenes, which might be expected for an oxidative reaction.

Underground Injection Control (UIC) Wells CLASS I - deep injection of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes into aquifers separated from underground sources of drinking water.
Underground Injection Control (UIC) Wells  CLASS I - deep injection of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes into aquifers separated from underground sources of drinking water.
Underground Injection Control (UIC) was established to protect the nation's fresh water aquifers from contamination by injection operations.
UIC wells are used to manage storm water (i.e., drywells) and sanitary waste (large on-site systems), return water to the ground, and help clean up contaminated sites.
This group of Native Americans is in the process of applying for UIC primacy on their land.
The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program issues Permits to Construct and Permits to Operate to facilities that intend to emplace fluids into the subsurface by means of an injection well.
The Underground Injection Control Program (UIC) protects groundwater quality by regulating discharges to UIC wells.
The UIC Program defines an injection well as any bored, drilled or a driven shaft or a dug hole, where the depth is greater than the largest surface dimension that is used to discharge fluids underground.
The Safe Drinking Water Act established the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program to provide these safeguards so that injection wells do not endanger current and future underground sources of drinking water (USDW).
The EPA has held primary enforcement authority for the UIC program on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana since the program was implemented in 1984.
The Department of Ecology adopted revisions to the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program rules on January 3, 2006.
Summary of DEQ Underground Injection Control (UIC) Rules.
Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe UIC.
It is true that Alabama's revised UIC program regulating hydraulic fracturing of coalbed formations (1) allows, under certain limited circumstances, the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into underground sources of drinking water and (2) does not contain State regulatory provisions analogous to the CFR part 144 and part 146 provisions cited by LEAF.
In addition, the state administers the delegated federal Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program, which protects the quality of the state's underground sources of drinking water, and prevents degradation of the quality of other aquifers adjacent to the injection zone.
The UIC Program Regulate the Very Different Types of Underground Injection.
EPA Region 5 Water: UIC Partnerships - Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe.
EPA also based its Alabama well classification decision on the fact that the general UIC well classification systems found in 40 CFR 144.6 and 146.5 do not expressly include hydraulic fracturing and the various permitting, construction, and other requirements found in parts 144 and 146 do not specifically address hydraulic fracturing.
DEP's Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program is required to protect Florida's underground sources of drinking water (USDWs).
David Miesbach has worked to incorporate a cross-media approach into the UIC (Underground Injection Control) program.
David has taken the initiative to familiarize himself with regulatory requirements outside the UIC program, and he has identified multimedia concerns not formerly understood in that program.
Class V wells are currently regulated by the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
The UIC Program must also protect water quality in aquifers that are next to the injection zone (the area that receives the waste).
An aquifer protected under the UIC Program is called an underground source of drinking water.
When the existing regulations for well logging were promulgated in 1987, the well logging process required drilling to stop while parts of the drilling pieces were removed before lowering a logging tool down a well.
Well logging usually refers to downhole measurements made via instrumentation that is lowered into the well at the end of a wireline cable.
Well logging is usually performed when the total depth of the hole is drill drill quick summary.
Well logging is performed at various intervals during the drilling of the well and when the total depth is drilled, which could range in depths from 300 m to 8000 m (1000 ft to 25,000 ft) or more.
Well logging is a technique used in the oil and gas industry for recording rock and fluid properties to find hydrocarbon zones in the geological formations below the Earth's crust.

Persons who use radiation sources for [wireline service] WELL LOGGING operations shall comply with this chapter, which is in addition to and not in substitution for other applicable requirements of this article.
Particular emphasis is laid on the acquisition, processing and interpretation of full waveform acoustic data and on the precautions to be employed in the use of well logs.
In crosswell logging, electrical or seismic sources and receivers are placed along the borehole in adjacent wells and a seismic signal or low-frequency electrical current is recorded by each receiver/electrode in each well and the receivers are moved up the hole to develop a series of ray paths.
Geologists, engineers, geophysicists, and other professionals with a need to understand the responses of common logging measurements to subsurface conditions, and become familiar with basic openhole well log interpretation techniques.
For well logging applications, the NRC is requiring that tritium neutron generator target sources be subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 39 except for the sealed source design and performance criteria.
Finally, in Chapter 6, several case studies are given of the interpretations of seismic surveys and well logs.
At the end of this course, students will be familiar with the acquisition and processing of individual well logs and with their role in identifying and quantifying key petrophysical properties of rock formations.
During a well logging [or tracer application] operation, the logging supervisor or other designated employee shall maintain direct surveillance of the operation to protect against unauthorized and unnecessary entry into a restricted area.
After completing this course you should be able to recommend a suite of well logs to solve common problems encountered in the subsurface, both in groundwater/engineering investigations and in oil/gas/minerals exploration.

Due to gradual depletion of Gazprom’s key deposits in Western Siberia (where gas extraction falls by 20-25 billion cubic meters (bcm) each year), Gazprom is actively studying new deposits suitable for large-scale exploration.
Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, which holds approximately 20% of the global gas reserves, is actively seeking to capitalize on this trend by increasing exports to existing markets and developing new markets.
Gazprom has already started to look for foreign partners with marketing capabilities and regasification facilities in North America, who would also be willing to invest in Gazprom’s new projects in Russia.
It is the longest river in Southwestern Asia with 2,700 km, and its actual annual volume is 35.9 billion cubic meters (bcm).[4] The Euphrates river is formed in Turkey by two major tributaries; the Murat and the Karasu.
The Bekhme Dam on the Greater Zap, the Dokan Dam and the Dibbis Dam on the Lesser Zap, the Darbandikhan Dam and the Hamrin Dam on the Diyala are the remaining operational dams on the Tigris river.
The French dream of a major dam on the Euphrates river became a major priority for the Syrian government, and growing relations with the soviet Union after the disruption of the United Arab Republic (U.A.R) led to a joint operation to built the Tabqa Dam, which was officially inaugurated in July of 1973.
